               Climbing in Yosemite National Park is a world-renowned experi- ence, attracting climbers from all over the globe. Yosemite Valley, in particular, is famous for its towering granite walls, majestic peaks, and challenging routes. Here’s an overview of climbing in Yosemite:<br><br>
               <strong>1. El Capitan:</strong> El Capitan is perhaps the most iconic climbing desti- nation in Yosemite. It’s a massive granite monolith that rises nearly 3,000 feet above the valley floor. Climbers come from far and wide to challenge themselves on routes like “The Nose” and “The Salathé Wall.” Climbing El Capitan is a multi-day adventure that requires careful planning and a high level of skill.<br><br>
               <strong>2. Half Dome:</strong> Half Dome is another famous formation in Yosemite. Climbing the Regular Northwest Face route to the summit involves a mix of hiking, steep rock climbing, and the use of cables on the final approach. Permits are required for the Half Dome cable route, and it’s a strenuous climb.<br><br>
               <strong>3. The Valley Walls:</strong> Yosemite Valley is home to numerous other granite walls and cliffs, offering a wide range of climbing experi- ences. Some popular locations include Royal Arches, Washington Column, and Cathedral Peak.<br><br>
               <strong>4. Tuolumne Meadows:</strong> Located at higher elevation, Tuolumne Meadows offers a different climbing experience with a variety of al- pine and high-country routes. The rock here is typically less crowd- ed than in the Valley.<br><br>
               <strong>5. Bouldering:</strong> Yosemite also offers excellent bouldering opportuni- ties, especially in areas like Camp 4. Camp 4 is famous for being a gathering place for climbers and has a rich climbing history.<br><br>
               <strong>6. Season:</strong> The climbing season in Yosemite generally runs from late spring through early fall, with peak conditions in late spring and early summer when the snow has melted, and the weather is mild. 7. Permits: Some climbing routes in Yosemite require permits, es- pecially those on Half Dome and for overnight climbs. It’s essential to check with the National Park Service for permit requirements and CLIMBING

               <strong>8. Safety:</strong> Climbing in Yosemite can be extremely challenging and dangerous, especially on the big walls. Climbers should have ad- vanced skills, proper equipment, and knowledge of the area. Many climbers also opt for guided trips or seek instruction from experi- enced guides.<br><br>
               Remember that climbing in Yosemite is a unique and often demand- ing experience. Safety should always be a top priority, and climbers should be prepared for a wide range of conditions and challenges. It’s also essential to respect the park’s rules and regulations to pre- serve the natural beauty and integrity of this iconic climbing desti- nation.
